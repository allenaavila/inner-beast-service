# Find Your Inner Beast REST API

This RESTful API service is designed to provide you with the data and structure needed to power an interactive quiz that matches users to their "kindred animal" (real or mythical) based on their personality traits.

For more information, see [Inner Beast Service Overview](./docs/overview/inner-beast-overview.md).

## Note

This REST API documentation is for a fictional service created as part of a university documentation course.

Many thanks to Mette Wadleigh for coming up with this REST API and being the subject matter expert for this project.
