# Get quiz definitions by ID

## Context

This action enables you to efficiently access and view the questions and answers that define a specific quiz.

## Prerequisites

Complete the [Get Started](../overview/get-started.md) topic to set up your computer for the Inner Beast Service.

## Steps

1. Open GitHub Desktop.

   Open your fork of the Inner Beast Service repository in your development system's command line.

2. From your command line, start your local service:

```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/inner-beast-service/api
 json-server -w beast-db.json
```

3. Open the Postman desktop app.  

   Select the **GET** method.
  
   Enter this URL:  

    ```shell
    http://localhost:3000/quizdefinitions?quizId={quizId}
    ```

    Click **Send**.

## Result

The service returns the `quizdefinition` that you requested using the `quizId`.
