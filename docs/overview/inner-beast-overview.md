# Inner Beast Service Overview

## Find Your Inner Beast REST API

With this API, you have the ability to store and manage user-specific results. This empowers developers to create applications to offer personalized histories, foster long-term engagement, and respect user data preferences.

This API enables your front-end application to:

* Generate a multiple choice personality quiz. Each answer choice links to a personality trait value in the **beast** resource. 
  
* Support a personality matching process by:
  * Generating the end-user's personality snapshot, 
  * Fetching animal data from the **beast** resource. 
  * Comparing the user's personality snapshot to the traits of each animal to determine the closest match. 

## Benefits of using this service

You can use this service to quickly implement a "personality match" feature in your web or mobile applications.

This service saves you time and effort because you won't have to manually build out the entire data model and content for quiz questions and animal profiles.
