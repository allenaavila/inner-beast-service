# Get Started

## Context

To simulate using this fictional API service, you must complete this topic before you follow any [tutorials](../tutorials/tutorials.md) or use the Inner Beast REST API.

## Prerequisites

On your computer, you must have:

* [A GitHub account](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/signup&ved=2ahUKEwi6uOqCnviNAxW2LTQIHSTyNFAQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0a6qEmIZVdziwPUb-hFApr)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [GitHub desktop app](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
* [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

## Steps

1. Access the [Inner Beast Service repository](https://github.com/allenaavila/inner-beast-service).
2. [Fork the Inner Beast Service repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui#forking-a-repository).
3. [Clone your fork of the Inner Beast repository to your GitHub desktop app](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui#forking-a-repository).

## Results

You now have a copy of the Inner Beast Service repository on your local computer that you can use.

## Next steps

Test that your development system is correctly configured.

1. Access your clone of the Inner Beast repository on your computer's command-line interface.

 ```shell
    cd api
    json-server -w beast-db.json
 ```

2. Verify you receive the following response to confirm that the service started successfully:

 ```shell
    \{^_^}/ hi!

    Loading beast-db.json
    Done

    Resources
    http://localhost:3000/beasts
    http://localhost:3000/quizdefinitions

    Home
    http://localhost:3000
```

3. Leave the first window open with the service running. Open a new window of your command-line interface to test calling the service.
   
```shell
   curl http://localhost:3000/beasts
```
4. Verify that the service returns the expected response.

   Example:

```json
